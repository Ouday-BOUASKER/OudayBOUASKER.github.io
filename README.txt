This website represents a portfolio for Ouday BOUASKER.
This website marks my very first website ever, so I know it is not going to be as mind-blowing as other websites since I am a beginner. But, I am just getting started.
While visiting this website, you will explore mainly 3 sections : 
-- Bio
-- Education
-- Professional Experience

Thank you for paying a visit, and I hope you like it.
Don't forget to give me feedback on how your experience was, was it helpful, interesting, or inspiring?
If you have any suggestions in mind to improve the content, feel free to text me.
